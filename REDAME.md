# Tension-Based AI Module

A small, pluggable engine that detects **structural tension** (context density / unresolved pressure) in signals and uses it to **route, pause, or intervene**—instead of optimizing only for prediction.

## Why
Statistical systems tend to collapse multi-track ambiguity into single estimates. This module preserves unresolved states as useful signal and acts on **where tension accumulates**.

## Core Ideas
- **Tension (τ):** computed measure of context density / rule collision.
- **Non-collapse handling:** keep parallel hypotheses alive when τ is high.
- **Signal gating:** route, suspend, or escalate based on τ thresholds.
- **Structural Karma hooks:** optional: log loop effects for governance analyses.

## Minimal Architecture (node chain)
1. **Ingest** → normalize inputs and constraints  
2. **Tension Detect** → τ = f(conflict, opacity, drift, coupling)  
3. **Classify τ** → {low | medium | high | critical} with hysteresis  
4. **Policy Router**  
   - low → proceed (predict/act)  
   - medium → branch (keep alternatives)  
   - high → **suspend & request context**  
   - critical → **escalate** to human/guardrail  
5. **Memory/Logs** → write τ traces + decisions (for audit/feedback)  

## Interfaces
```ts
// pseudo-types
type Input = { x: any; constraints?: object; context?: object }
type TensionScore = number // 0..1
type TensionClass = 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical'

function detectTension(input: Input): { tau: TensionScore, cls: TensionClass }
function routeByTension(cls: TensionClass, next: () => any): 'proceed' | 'branch' | 'suspend' | 'escalate'
